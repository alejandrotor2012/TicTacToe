# TicTacToe
My python design of a game of Tic Tac Toe. The game was originally designed using Anaconda's Jupyter notebooks. However, I uploaded a .py file in order to run the code on PyCharm or any other IDE. A .ipynb file is also attached, of course. 

This project is meant as an introduction to python through prodecural programing. Project idea supplied by Pierian Data Inc,via Udemy.com(Portilla, 'Completed Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3').
